# Medical_data_visualizer

#In this project, you will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

#The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. We will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.

#Creating a chart similar to examples/Figure_1.png, where we show the counts of good and bad outcomes for the cholesterol, gluc, alco, active, and smoke variables for patients with cardio=1 and cardio=0 in different panels.Create a chart similar to examples/Figure_1.png, where we show the counts of good and bad outcomes for the cholesterol, gluc, alco, active, and smoke variables for patients with cardio=1 and cardio=0 in different panels.
